# Page

As described in the page on components Muban exists of three types of components. The blocks are the biggest components and they are used to build up the pages. A page in Muban is *a single file* that contains the structure and the data for that page. 

A page can be in one of the following formats and can be used interchangeably.

1. Yaml
2. [Json](./12-guides.md#Using-JSON-for-page-files)
3. [JavaScript](./12-guides.md#Using-JavaScript-for-page-files)

Since `yaml` is less verbose, and can better handle multiline content, we've chosen that as the default. If you want to use any of the other formats please see the Tutorial section.

A page file is build up in three different sections.

1. Title
2. Meta
3. Blocks

### Title

The title is the most basic part and describes the page title.  It is used for the following values:

- The `<title>` tag in the `<head>`.
- The name of the HTML page
- The path in the generated  `index.html` overview.

```yaml
title: 'Home'
```

### Meta

The meta section contains the information that is used on the generated `index.html` overview page.

```yaml
meta:
  id: '01-home' # can be number or string, used for ordering
  status: 'dev' # dev, qa, feedback, done
  notes: 'Look at this awesome page.' # add some information about the page
  category: 'pages' # to group pages in the overview
```

> **Note:** These values are not used in a production build and are only there for development purpose.

### Blocks

The blocks section is the list of blocks that should be rendered to display the page. 

A block exists of two values. 

1. `name`
2. `data`

#### Name

The name is the name of the block component that should be rendered. 

> **Note:** Keep in mind that the casing should be in `slug-case`

```yaml
blocks:
  - name: 'my-block'
    data: "import!../app/component/block/my-block/data.yaml"
  - name: 'my-other-block'
    data: "import!../app/component/block/my-other-block/data.yaml"    
```

#### Data

The data provides the content and structure of your block, it represents the eventual backend data that will be used to render the templates on the server. Usually all blocks contain data and it is defined on the page that the block is rendered. 

There can be two ways of providing data to your block.

##### Local data

Local data is data that is directly defined in the data key of your block. You will probably not use this but if your block uses specific data that is only required on that page you could define it on page level.

```yaml
blocks:
  - name: 'my-block'
    data: 
      title: "Hi I'm a the same block but with different content! ðŸ’ª"
      content: "I'm the specific body copy for the block."
```

> **Note:** keep in mind that if you choose to use local data you will have to write all data for that block locally.

##### Imported data

Imported data is data that is imported from another location. If you look at the block section on the page about components you can see that all blocks all have a local `data.yaml` file. This file can be used to provide the same data to multiple instances of the same block without having to write it multiple times.

```yaml
blocks:
  - name: 'my-block'
    data: "import!../app/component/block/my-block/data.yaml"
```
