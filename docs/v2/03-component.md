# Component

A component is a potentially re-usable set of logic, behaviours and interface elements that speeds up the creation of an application. If you work on a Muban project its good too keep in mind that everything is a component.  

## Types

Muban basically has three types of components that extend each other.

- *component*

  â‡©

- *smart-component*

  â‡©

- *block*

### Component

The most basic form of a component within Muban would be the regular component. The regular component is used for basically all user interface elements that do not require any logic or functionality. 

The basic component has the following structure.

```
my-component/
	- my-component.hbs
	- my-component.scss
	- preset.js
```

#### Handlebars

The `.hbs` file is the core of any component within Muban. It contains the HTML that is required for component

The most basic example of a Muban component could be a file called `button.hbs` 

```html
<div class="my-component">Hi ðŸ‘‹</div>
```

#### SCSS

Since you will probably never render out HTML without styling there is also a `.scss` file available. This file contains all the styling for your component. To make sure it's loaded you will have to add it to the `.hbs` file. This way webpack will make sure it is bundled in your main css file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./my-component.scss">

<div class="my-component">Hi! ðŸ‘‹</div>
```

Since we are now trying to load a file called `my-button.scss` we will have to add it to the same folder.

```scss
.my-component {
	color: red;
}
```

*Note: The `.scss` file is technically optional so if you don't need it you could remove it.*

#### Preset

*Note: If you have removed storybook from your Muban project you can skip this part.*

The final file for any component is the `preset.js` file, this file contains the information required by Storybook to render out the stories. To read more about storybook and the preset files please see the page on Storybook.

### Smart-component

A smart-component is the next step in components, it has the same base as the basic component except it also has a TypeScript file that contains logic.

The smart-component has the following structure.

```
my-smart-component/
	- my-smart-component.hbs
	- my-smart-component.scss
	- MySmartComponent.ts
	- preset.js
```

#### Handlebars

In the handlebars the only difference is that the root element of your component will have an extra data attribute that is used to initialise the component.

```html
<div class="my-smart-component" data-component="my-smart-component">I'm smart! ðŸ¤“</div>
```

#### SCSS

The `.scss` file for the smart-component is exactly the same as the one for the basic component. 

#### Preset

The `preset.js` file for the smart-component is exactly the same as the one for the basic component. 

#### TypeScript

The smart part of the smart-component is the TypeScript file. This file adds all the logic to your component. To enable it simply load it in your `.hbs` the same way you did as for the `.scss` file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./my-smart-component.scss">
<script src="./MySmartComponent.ts"></script>

<div class="my-smart-component" data-component="my-smart-component">I'm smart! ðŸ¤“</div>
```

Since we are now trying to load a file called `MyButton.ts` we will have to add it to the same folder.

```typescript
import AbstractComponent from "../AbstractComponent";

export default class MySmartComponent extends AbstractComponent {
  static displayName:string = 'my-smart-component';

  constructor(el:HTMLElement) {
    super(el);
  }

  public dispose() {
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

Here you can see that we create a class that extends the `AbstractComponent`, this makes sure that we have all the base logic that is required for Muban to initialise the components and provide the default functionality.  

*Note: If you don't want to use TypeScript you could also create a JavaScript file, just keep in mind that your will lose all typings.*

### Block

The final step in components would be a block, a block is the largest type of component in Muban. Blocks are the building stones on which the pages within Muban are build. They are loaded on the pages and will have data provided to them. 

A block has the following structure.

```
my-block/
	- my-block.hbs
	- my-block.scss
	- MyBlock.ts
	- data.yaml
	- preset.js
```

#### Handlebars

The `.hbs` file for a block is exactly the same as the one  for a smart-component.

#### SCSS

The `.scss` file for a block is exactly the same as the one  for a smart-component.

#### Preset

The `preset.js` file for a block is exactly the same as the one for the smart-component. 

#### Data

One of the main things that separates a block from a smart-component is the data that is attached to it. The data files provide the content and structure of your block, they represent the eventual backend data that will be used to render the templates on the server.

Data files an be one of the following formats.

1. Yaml
2. Json
3. JavaScript

Since `yaml` is less verbose, and can better handle multiline content, we've chosen that as the default. If you want to use any of the other formats please see the Tutorial section.

You could create as many data files as you want for each specific situation, for now just add a single `data.yaml` file for your block. 

Inside of your data file we can add the content that will be rendered in the block. There are two ways of defining data. 

1. Local data
2. Referenced data

*Note: Make sure to match your data structure with the backend to avoid major differences while implementing*

##### Local data

The local data is the data dat is entered directly in your data file. It is the most simple way of adding data but in the long run this could cause a lot of duplication.

````yaml
title: "Hi I'm a block! ðŸ’ª"
content: "I'm the body copy for the block."
````

##### Imported data

This imported data is fetched from another file using the [json-import-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-import-loader). You can import other files by adding the following prefix to your path.

```javascript
import!path-to-file
```

Data could come from any other folder within your project, so if you would like to add `otherContent` to your data file it would look like this.

```yaml
title: "Hi I'm a block! ðŸ’ª"
content: "I'm the body copy for the block."
otherContent: "import!./some-other-content.yaml"
```

*Note: Keep in mind that import paths are relative!*

## Creating a component

Now that we have covered all the parts that make up the different component types you could create them manually. This process takes up a lot of time and increases chance of errors! To avoid this you can use the [seng-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seng-generator) to generate them for you! If you followed the preparation instructions you will by now have this installed. 

### Using the wizard

Start by opening the terminal in the root of your project and run the following command.

```bash
sg wizard
```

This will start up the wizard and it will prompt you with a couple of questions. Use the provided instructions to select the template that you want to use. 

*Note: Leave the page for what it is now, we will cover this in the section on pages.*

```bash
? Which template do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
  block
> component
  page
  smart-component
```

After that enter the desired name of your component.

*Note: The casing will automatically be changed to the required format.*

```
? Which template do you want to use? component
? What name do you want to use? () 
```

After you've provided the name you can choose the location where the component should be created. The default directory is shown so if you don't want to change this just press `enter`  to continue.

*Note: If you want to provide a different location please provide the full relative path from the root of your project.*

```bash
? Which template do you want to use? component
? What name do you want to use? my-component
? Where do you want to create the component? (./src/app/component) 
```

After you pressed enter it will notify you that the component has been successfully created.

```bash
? Which template do you want to use? component
? What name do you want to use? my-component
? Where do you want to create the component? ./src/app/component
Generating files from 'component' template with name: my-component

Done!
```

### Using the shorthand

While using the wizard to generate your components is very easy and descriptive of what's happening it requires quite a lot of interaction. If you do not want to go through this every time you can use the shorthand to create the components.

Open up the terminal in the root of your project and run the following command:

```bash
sg component my-component
```

This have the same result as when the wizard is followed.
